# Chatroom

A simple chatroom that uses the [wagon-chat API](https://github.com/lewagon/wagon-chat-api), created with Javascript.

### What I learned
* Make GET and POST requests to an API code using `fetch`
* Use AJAX calls to implement a dynamic chat-room that instantly displays latest messages and post new ones.
